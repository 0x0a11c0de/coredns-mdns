# mDNS

## Name

mDNS - CoreDNS plugin that reads mDNS records from the local network and responds
to queries based on those records.

## Description

Useful for providing mDNS records to non-mDNS-aware applications by making them
accessible through a standard DNS server.

## Syntax

~~~
mdns example.com
~~~

## Examples

As a prerequisite to using this plugin, there must be systems on the local
network broadcasting mDNS records. Note that the .local domain will be
replaced with the configured domain. For example, `test.local` would become
`test.example.com` using the configuration below.

Specify the domain for the records.

~~~ corefile
example.com {
	mdns example.com
}
~~~

And test with `dig`:

~~~ txt
dig @localhost baremetal-test-extra-1.example.com

;; ANSWER SECTION:
baremetal-test-extra-1.example.com. 60 IN A   12.0.0.24
baremetal-test-extra-1.example.com. 60 IN AAAA fe80::f816:3eff:fe49:19b3
